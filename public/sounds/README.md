# Sound Files Placeholder

This directory should contain the following sound files for the chess game:

- `move.mp3` - Sound for regular piece moves
- `capture.mp3` - Sound for piece captures
- `check.mp3` - Sound when king is in check
- `castle.mp3` - Sound for castling moves
- `game-end.mp3` - Sound when game ends

You can download chess sound effects from various sources or record your own.
Some suggested sources:
- freesound.org
- lichess.org (open source chess sounds)
- chess.com sounds (check licensing)

For now, the game will work without sounds but will show console warnings.
